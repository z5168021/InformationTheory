    <h2>What is Evolutionary Ecology?</h2>
    <p>Evolutionary ecology is used at a molecular level to make predictions and test forecasts regarding the behavior and diversity of variants. The information analysis is part of a wide spectrum also known as the q-profile containing concise but rich details of diversity. Some values include allelic richness (q=0), Shannon information (q=1) and heterozygosity (q=2). Undoubtedly, our genes are carriers of our evolutionary history. They also provide a snapshot into recent demonography or possibly even future trajectories, however information theory has rarely been employed to investigate molecular evolution. In order to build a q-profile, there must be a conversion from Entropy values <sup>q</sup>H = <sup>0</sup>H, <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>2</sup>H, etc) to their equivalent <sup>q</sup>D values, (<sup>q</sup>D = <sup>0</sup>D, <sup>1</sup>D, <sup>2</sup>D) which is a measure of equally frequent alleles required to yield the observed <sup>q</sup>H in the sample. The use of q values has been encouraged in studying ecology as they provide insight into diversity and thus the <sup>q</sup>D measure is also known as the true diversity. A more recently explored method for extraction of information includes using Shannon information (entropy) theory and 85% of studies validate that q = 1 provides qualitatively similar results to q = 0 or q = 2.

   <p>The Shannon information based theory has many benefits including providing greater sensitivity for detecting newer/adaptive alleles and conservation management. While analysing at the overall q-profile is informative, only q = 1 measure inspects a combination of desirable characteristics which are crucial for tracking evolutionarily important phenomena. However, using q = 0  has also proved to be more sensitive to rare alleles compared to the other values. Additionally, q = 2 also provides  sensitive analysis for frequent variants and has relatively fewer sampling problems. As a result of each value being unique and adding to the overall analysis, it is important to look at a q-profile to extract insight into evolutionary and ecological processes as well as derive a comprehensive profile of genetic diversity.

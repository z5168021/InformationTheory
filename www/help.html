        <div class="panel-body">This is a brief walk through on how to use the <sup>q</sup>D Profile tab. In brief,
          there is background information with reference to the paper which included the equations and calculation
          method. In addition, there is a single view and comparative view when analysing q-profiles of different
          sequences. </div>

        <div class="panel-body">This video includes a run through of analysis of variation over time using the Shan-Het
          equation. The page contains a summary of the equations with a link to the paper it was derived from.
          Additionally,  there is a comparative view to compare various populations against each other. If you are
          looking to analyse a fasta file of population, there is a tab to supply your own population for analysis.
          There is also a feature to download a report which consist the the background, equations and results
          in HTML and Word DOC format. </div>

        <div class="panel-body"> This video describes the steps to design your own model population of any size and
          haploid distribution. To use this function, first enter a name to save the population and input a nucleotide
          sequence in the given form. There is an additional feature to increase teh occurrences of the given
          haplotype. Furthermore, the add new button can generate nucleotide sequence which are mutations from the
          original sequence.
